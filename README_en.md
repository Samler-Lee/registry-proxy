# Registry Proxy

A lightweight container registry proxy service

## ‚ú® Features

- Support for multiple upstream
- Support for private registry login authentication
- Support for full-path proxy (proxy push operations and more)
- No disk caching, friendly to devices with limited disk capacity
- Low memory consumption
- Support for Let's Encrypt automatic certificate management

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

A `config.toml` file is provided in the project root directory, which serves as the default configuration file for this project. You can also obtain it by directly running `registry-proxy serve`.

### proxy.coverAll

Whether to enable full-path proxy. When enabled, you can use it to proxy push operations and other related APIs. Reference: [HTTP API V2](https://distribution.github.io/distribution/spec/api/)

**Note: If you need to proxy push operations, the upstream addresses in `proxy.binding` must be official registry addresses**

Default value: `false`

### proxy.binding

This configuration item is a mapping between domain names and upstream addresses. When accessing with the corresponding domain name, the request will be proxied to the corresponding upstream address.

Taking the mapping relationship in the default configuration as an example, if you access `docker.registry-proxy.localhost`, the service will forward your request to `registry-1.docker.io`.

### server.listen

The address and port that the HTTP service listens on

Default value: `:80`

### server.logLevel

The log level for console output. You can adjust it to `DEBUG` to view some details of request forwarding, but it will generate a large amount of logs.

Default value: `INFO`

### server.tls.enable

Whether to enable TLS

Default value: `false`

### server.tls.listen

The address and port that the HTTPS service listens on

Default value: `:443`

### server.tls.useLetsEncrypt

Whether to enable automatic certificate management based on `Let's Encrypt`. This configuration is mutually exclusive with `server.tls.certPath` and `server.tls.keyPath`. If this configuration is enabled, the latter will be disabled.

**Note: If this configuration is enabled, please ensure that port `80` or `443` can correctly access this service, otherwise Let's Encrypt will refuse to issue certificates. Reference: [Challenge Types](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/).**

Default value: `true`

### server.tls.certPath

TLS certificate file path

Default value: `server.crt`

### server.tls.keyPath

TLS certificate key file path

Default value: `server.key`

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment

This project was developed and tested using Go 1.25 during development. It is recommended to use Go 1.25 or above for compilation and deployment.

This project supports the following deployment methods. You can choose according to your preference:

### Docker

#### Execute the following command in the project root directory to build the container image, or directly use the pre-built public image
```shell
docker build -t registry-proxy:latest .
```

#### Start the container
```shell
docker run -itd -p 8000:80 -p 8443:443 -v ./config.toml:/app/config.toml --restart=always registry-proxy:latest
```

or

```shell
docker run -itd -p 8000:80 -p 8443:443 -v ./config.toml:/app/config.toml --restart=always ghcr.io/samler-lee/registry-proxy:latest
```

This way, the container will listen on the system's `8000` and `8443` ports. You can test by accessing `http://docker.registry-proxy.localhost:8000/v2/`.

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided in the project root directory, which you can use for Docker Compose deployment.

First, refer to the Docker section to build the container image, or directly use the pre-built public image, then execute the following command to start the service
```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

**Public image address: `ghcr.io/samler-lee/registry-proxy:latest`. If you want to use it, remember to modify the `image` field in `docker-compose.yml`.**

### Binary

Compile the binary file
```shell
go build -o registry-proxy
```

Start the server
```shell
./registry-proxy serve
```

## üìñ Usage Recommendations

During the design and testing of this project, the deployment architecture used was `nginx` ---> `docker compose` ---> `registry-proxy`. It is recommended that you also adopt a similar architecture for deployment, which makes it convenient for you to reuse ports 80 and 443 and manage certificates uniformly, unless you plan to deploy only this service on the device.
